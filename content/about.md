By day, I'm a Senior Executive Advisor at Confluent, working with some of the biggest names in the German-speaking market. Basically, I help companies turn exciting ideas in data streaming and artificial intelligence into reality. 

With 18+ years navigating the tech landscape — from financial services and consulting to adventures in cloud computing and artifical intelligence at AWS, Allianz, and Accenture - I've learned a lot and love sharing that knowledge.

My job involves translating complex tech topics into clear, practical strategies. Think of me as a guide through the fascinating worlds of data streaming and AI, making sure we have fun along the way.

When I'm not immersed in tech, you'll usually find me hiking trails with my dog, skiing down a snowy slope, or simply enjoying nature with my lovely wife and our two energetic daughters. Time outdoors is my best source of inspiration — and sanity!

I also believe that IT is just like cooking: with the right recipes and some experience, both can be incredibly fun and enlighten others. That's why I've started my own Blog and workshops section with tasty data recipes, that you can re-cook and adapt as you like. So, please try this at home, (or work)! 

Glad you stopped by — let's dive into tech together!
