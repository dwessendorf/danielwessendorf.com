Organizations across industries are increasingly recognizing the critical importance of harnessing real-time data to maintain competitive advantage and meet complex customer demands. Confluent's recent white paper, "The Data Streaming Organization: Driving Value & Competitive Advantage From Data Streaming," introduces a structured framework designed to help organizations navigate this transformative journey.

The purpose of this framework is to enable organizations to effectively leverage real-time data by establishing clear strategies, cohesive operational practices, and robust technical platforms. As data becomes the lifeblood of modern enterprises, Confluent's insights highlight the necessity of viewing data streaming not just as a technological solution but as an integral socio-technical initiative that aligns closely with business goals.

The Data Streaming Organization framework is built around three core pillars:

## 1. Value from Data
This pillar emphasizes the importance of deriving clear, measurable value from real-time data by creating well-defined data products. It involves identifying strategic use cases that benefit significantly from real-time insights and establishing repeatable patterns and best practices to ensure consistency and speed of adoption across teams.

## 3. Unified Platform
Central to the framework is the creation of a Unified Data Streaming Platform, ensuring seamless access to data across the organization. This pillar emphasizes the importance of technical excellence through effective cluster strategies, multi-tenancy controls, and a self-service internal developer platform. It ensures that the platform is secure, reliable, and easy to use, enabling broad adoption without sacrificing governance. [Read more](/blog/2025-03-13-dso-unified-platform)
