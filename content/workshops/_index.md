## Introduction

While being at AWS I loved the concept of having blog posts  for smaller chunks of information and workshops for diving deep into various aspects of the topic.

I want to follow this pattern here and beside my regular blog post I will deepen the one or other topic in more details in labs or workshops.

Please find below my very first workshop of this kind. Pass on by from time to time as I plan to evolve these workshops gradually.

## Current Workshops:
