## Introduction


In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through the process of building a self-service developer platform using Spotify's Backstage as the foundation and Confluent Cloud as a key service offering. This step-by-step tutorial will take you from a basic Backstage installation to a full-featured platform that enables developers to provision their own Confluent Cloud environments and clusters via a streamlined, GitOps-driven workflow.

Following diagram visualizes the flow of the application.
